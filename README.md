This is my OpenGL project

To install OpenGL: sudo apt-get install cmake libx11-dev xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev libglew1.5 libglew1.5-dev libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev

This project runs on Linux system

Implement the project: Please follow the instructions below to compile the program scene-start:
1. Open a terminal window and change directory (using the 'cd' command) to where scene-start.cpp located.
2. Type: ./setup-once Note: You only need to do this once.
3. Type: ls -l You should see two small symbolic link files (created by Step 2 above) pointing to the actual dynamic library file.
4. Type: make This should compile scene-start.cpp and create the executable program scene-start.
5. Type: source ./setup You need to do this command every time you open a new terminal window.
6. Type: ./scene-start to run the skeleton program scene-start generated from the compilation (step 4 above). Note: you need to make sure the models-textures directory is in the same directory as scene-start.cpp
